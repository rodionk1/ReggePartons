Implementation of reaction-diffusion approach for calculating Reggeon Field Theory amplitudes.
The amplitudes are calculated for a specific version of the theory with triple and quartic vertex which has a one-to-one correspondense with a reaction-diffusion system.
Code for calculating Reggeon Field Theory amplitudes for elastic scattering, its Single-Diffractive and Low-Mass Single-Diffractive cuts are contained in respective folders.
In the root folder a code performing integrations needed to obtain corresponding cross sections.

The code was used to obtain results contained in a series of papers which also contain some implementation details
